### Hi there 👋

<!--
**kittimaratana/kittimaratana** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hey y'all 👋, I'm Kittima! Transitioning from data science to software engineering is my latest adventure. I graduated from the University of Toronto in industrial engineering and was among the first cohorts to specialize in artificial intelligence. I love problem-solving, whether it's participating in case competitions, tackling LeetCode questions, or brainstorming ideas to optimize day-to-day work with analytics, algorithms, and machine learning. ⚙️

Throughout my career, I've had some cool and unique opportunities. My internship experiences include researching abroad in Denmark 🇩🇰, working as a full-stack intern, and working cross-functionally to revamp how weather alerts are deployed to Canadians by designing the system architecture.

Post-graduation, my role evolved from a data analyst to a data scientist at the same rate that my love for programming increased. I was part of the pioneering team at Universal Music Canada 🎧, advancing music and tech by building products in the analytics and machine learning space.

I was offered a fully funded bootcamp through Brainstation 👩‍💻, and I decided to partake in the software engineering stream. As I graduate, I am excited to see what opportunities come my way.

In my spare time, I love to travel, work out, and sing. I'm also passionate about women's community building. I've participated in Women in STEM conferences 👭, raised money for literacy, and am currently involved with Monday Girl, where I help support and empower other women while building a lasting community.
