### Hi there, I'm Kittima 👋

Transitioning from data science to software engineering is my latest adventure. I graduated from the University of Toronto in industrial engineering and was amongst the first cohorts to specialize in artificial intelligence. I love problem-solving, whether it's participating in case competitions, tackling LeetCode questions, or brainstorming ideas to optimize day-to-day work with analytics, algorithms, and machine learning. ⚙️

Throughout my career, I've had some cool and unique opportunities. My internship experiences include researching abroad in Denmark 🇩🇰, working as a full-stack developer intern, and working cross-functionally to revamp how weather alerts are deployed to Canadians by designing the system architecture.

Post-graduation, my role evolved from a data analyst to a data scientist at the same rate that my love for programming increased. I was part of the pioneering team at Universal Music Canada 🎧, advancing music and tech by building products in the analytics and machine learning space.

I was offered a fully funded bootcamp through Brainstation 👩‍💻, and I decided to partake in the software engineering stream. As I graduate, I am excited to see what software engineering opportunities come my way.

In my spare time, I love to travel, workout, and sing. I'm also passionate about women's community building 👭. I've participated in Women in STEM conferences, raised money for literacy, and am currently a member at Monday Girl, which is an organization that empowers women through fostering lasting and supportive community.
