### Hi there, I'm Kittima 👋

<!--
**kittimaratana/kittimaratana** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm a Machine Learning Developer with high expertise in full-stack web development, data science, database management, systems design, cloud platforms, and machine learning. I graduated from the University of Toronto in industrial engineering and was among the first cohorts to specialize in artificial intelligence. I love problem-solving, whether it's participating in case competitions, tackling LeetCode questions, or brainstorming ideas to optimize day-to-day work with analytics, algorithms, and machine learning. ⚙️

Throughout my career, I've had some cool and unique opportunities. My internship experiences include researching abroad in Denmark 🇩🇰, working as a full-stack developer intern, and working cross-functionally to revamp how weather alerts are deployed to Canadians by designing the system architecture.

Post-graduation, my role evolved from a junior data analyst to a data scientist at the same rate that my love for programming increased. I was part of the pioneering team at Universal Music Canada 🎧, advancing music and tech by building scalable products in the analytics and machine learning space and influencing music initiatives through data driven approach (i.e., leading to artist winning Juno Awards, surpassing music consumption milestones, global collaboration deals).

I was offered a fully funded bootcamp through Brainstation 👩‍💻, and I decided to partake in the software engineering stream. Now I am working as a Machine Learning Developer (SWE II) at AltaML disrupting the ML industry!

In my spare time, I love to travel, workout, and sing. I'm also passionate about women's community building 👭. I've participated in Women in STEM conferences, raised money for literacy, and was a member at Monday Girl, which is an organization that empowers women through fostering a supportive community.
